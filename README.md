<h3 align="center">Full-Stack Developer | Crafting Scalable, Gamified Mobile Apps with Flutter</h3>

<p align="center">
  I’m a Software Engineer and co-founder of <strong>Flowo</strong> — a neuro-inclusive planning app designed for ADHD users. With a deep focus on <strong>Flutter</strong>, <strong>Dart</strong>, and <strong>Clean Architecture</strong>, I specialize in cross-platform development that prioritizes accessibility, performance, and joy. Currently, I'm leading two projects: <strong>RoadWise</strong>, a gamified app for learning traffic rules, and <strong>BeerTinder</strong>, a social discovery app for beer lovers. My mission is to build delightful, human-centered tools that solve real-world problems with empathy and precision.
